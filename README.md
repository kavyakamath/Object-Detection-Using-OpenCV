# Object-Detection-Using-OpenCV

This project demonstrates object detection using OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library in Python. It includes implementations for detecting objects in images, videos, and real-time webcam streams. The object detection model used in this project is based on the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) architecture with a MobileNetV3 backbone, trained on the COCO dataset.

# Features
+ Detect objects in images with bounding boxes and labels.
+ Analyze videos and perform object detection frame by frame.
+ Real-time object detection using a webcam feed.
+ Supports a wide range of object classes from the COCO dataset.
